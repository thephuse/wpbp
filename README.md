Theme Boilerplate Notes
=======================

Basics
------
- header and footer based on (our old) html5 boilerplate, with modernizr and jquery
- blog layout with sidebar on right by default, set up with a home page slideshow (based on three recent WP projects with these similar features)
- functions.php for setting up sidebar, menu, excerpts, custom post types, etc.

Add-ons
-------
- optional theme part for a featured post rotator, good for use with Yet Another Featured Posts plugin or Easy Featured Content and slides.js
- optional part to show recent posts with thumbnail
- write_panels.php for custom post inputs and other php scripts from the Phuse's resources
- plugins.js contains slides.js
- script.js contains slide initialization and simple multi-level dropdown menu
